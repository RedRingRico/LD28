RED RING RICO'S LUDUM DARE #28 ENTRY
GAME DESIGN DOCUMENT

One, what?
**********
One life
One minute
One game
One objective
One level
One attempt

One life would indicate that the enemies in the game are challenging or that
the game is limited in scope to make it hard for the player to progress, among
many other possiblities, though these are the first two that jump out at me.

I'm drawn to the One Life thing, it would allow for me to make the game
incrementally more difficult (both in terms of making it and playing it)

A top-down shooter might be fun, though a platformer would be more appropriate
in terms of how many entries are platformers =P

I wouldn't mind doing something like a isometric view, but the art would be
more than I'm capable of doing right now.

After some whiteboarding, I've come to the conclusion that a top-down Arena
shooter would be doable and the one life deal might make for some fun.

There's an image of a Whiteboard in Docs/Whiteboarding for reference.
